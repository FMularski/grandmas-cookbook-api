## üç≥ About
Grandma's Cookbook is an API project allowing to browse and manage food recipes. The project itself consists of three docker containers being: the web application, a relational database and a reverse proxy server for serving the static content. The app was created as a recruitment task.

* Getting list of all existing recipes
* Getting a particular recipe by its id
* Creating new recipes (superusers only)
* Updating existing recipes (superusers or objects' creators only)
* Deleting recipes
* Browsing recipes added to users' cookbooks
* Browsing objects with django admin panel
